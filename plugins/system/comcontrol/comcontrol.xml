	Component Content Control V1.61 - For Joomla 1.6, 1.7 and 2.5 websites. Do not use with Joomla 1.5 websites.
	This plugin allows you to specify the pages of particular components that are visible to guests
	versus those pages that require the user to login first.
	To use this extension, be sure to first set the components that you wish to control to 'public' in the component's administration page.
	Then enter the parameters here so that Component Content Control will control whether the component pages are public vs private.
	For components where you want most of the pages to be public, but have some private pages (requires login) -
	put those component names in the Mostly Public Components parameter.
	The component name is the part of the url that comes after '/index.php?option=' . For example, for MyBlog, it is 'com_myblog' .
	If you have an SEF component installed, you may want to temporarily disable it so that you can see the component name in the url for the page.
	You can enter several component names, just leave a space between them.
	Then enter the 'Private Tags' (url fragments) for the Mostly Public component pages that you want to make private - for example: article&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=53 or blogger=Roger  etc.
	You can enter several tags, just leave a space between them. This is case-sensitive, so be sure capital letters are correct!
	For components where you want most of the pages to be private (require login), but have some public pages -
	put those component names in the Mostly Private Components parameter.
	You can enter several component names, just leave a space between them.
	Then enter the 'Public Tags' (url fragments) for the Mostly Private component pages that you want to make public.
	You can use both the Mostly Public and Mostly Private parameters - of course, do not enter the same component name in both the Mostly Public
	and Mostly Private parameters.
